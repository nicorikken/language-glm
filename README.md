## Goals
- Full syntax parsing
- Practical syntax highlighting
- Keyword recognition
- Keyword completion using [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus)
- Handy snippets for source editing
- Extensive test coverage
- Structural folding support
- Prettify command like [pretty-json](https://github.com/federomero/pretty-json)
- Support for [symbols tree view](https://github.com/xndcn/symbols-tree-view)

## Inspiration and reuse
- [GLM language parser](https://github.com/sordina/GLM)
- [Sublime Text GLM support](https://github.com/dpinney/gridlabSublime) _which is sadly in practice only a C language port_
- [GitHub flavoured Markdown support](https://github.com/atom/language-gfm) _as a generic atom language example_
